JavaScript is everywhere \u2013 on Desktop/Server/Mobile.You can create mobile web app with javascript and html5, which has lot of advantages like save licensing cost $99 yearly to pay Apple for making IOS apps and you don\u2019t have to purchase MAC laptop to make your IOS app(Apple\u2019s app can only be made in MAC).\r\n",

But, Cycle Sort almost always makes less number of writes compared to Selection Sort.  In Cycle Sort, each value is either written zero times, if it\u2019s already in its correct position, or written one time to its correct position.
